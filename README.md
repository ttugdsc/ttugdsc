# TTUGDSC

Public website for the Texas Tech chapter of the Google Developers Student Clubs
Here you can watch and even participate in the development on the TTU GDSC Website. Eventually, it'll be the single point of contact for the club. A one stop shop for our events, team, and projects.

_To avoid unnecessary pain, we recommend reading up a bit or watching a bit on React and Next.js._

If you want to contribute, follow [our guidelines](https://github.com/ttugdsc/ttugdsc/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION.md).

For a breakdown on what we're shooting for, check out our [project page](https://www.figma.com/file/uEBOlD2GGmVO0sCAKTowAh/Lo-fi-Wireframe-Kit-Launchpad-for-Website-Wireframe) and our [discussion page](https://github.com/ttugdsc/ttugdsc/discussions).


## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies 

```bash
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ttugdsc/ttugdsc

npm i
```

Then, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

## Happy coding 🎉🙌
