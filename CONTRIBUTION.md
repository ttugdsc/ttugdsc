# How can I participate?

Here you can watch and even participate in the development on the TTU GDSC Website. Eventually, it'll be the single point of contact for the club. A one stop shop for our events, team, and projects.

_To avoid unnecessary pain, we recommend reading up a bit or watching a bit on Vuejs and Gridsome._

For a breakdown on what we're shooting for, check out our [project page](https://www.figma.com/file/uEBOlD2GGmVO0sCAKTowAh/Lo-fi-Wireframe-Kit-Launchpad-for-Website-Wireframe) and our [discussion page](https://github.com/ttugdsc/ttugdsc/discussions).

**Never EVER merge to main/master :)** or else we'll do you like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9IIZ3UMQB8).

## Guidelines

We'll be following the [Creative Commons Contribution Guidelines](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/) pretty closely until we need something more specific for our projects but it breaks down as
like this -

### Issues available for community contribution:

- You'll see a `help wanted` tag on features that we're looking to add.
- You don't need our permission to work on one of these issues.
- Comment on it and say you're working on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.
- You can make as many commits as you want, they'll be squashed on merging.

If you want to try and tackle one of these issues you would fork the repository, create a new branch from the `develop` branch, and start doing your work in the `src` directory.

[PULL REQUEST GUIDELINES](https://opensource.creativecommons.org/contributing-code/pr-guidelines/)
You don't need to follow these strictly buuut don't be sloppy. Document as much as you can and push early and often.

### Member proposed issues

If you feel like there's a feature that the website should definitely have then bring you would follow these steps

1. Create an issue in the [issues section](https://github.com/ttugdsc/ttugdsc/issues) of the repo
2. A maintainer will mark it appropriately and discuss it with you.

**We will not be accepting pull requests without accompanying issues.**

Issue format:

**(feat/bug/power-up) _Name of feature_**

**Description**
Here you'll explain what feature want to add, what bug you've found, or what enhancement you want to make to what's already built.

**Reason**
Here you'll explain why this feature needs to be added. It's important to know when a feature is necessary and when its fluff. "Do we really need this animation here?"

### Issues not available for community contribution:

These issues will be marked `🔒 staff only`.
`🔒 staff only` issues require infrastructure access or institutional knowledge that would be impractical to provide to the community, think api keys or continuous integration changes.

## Issues not ready for work:

- `🚧 status: blocked` Blocked by other work that needs to be done first
- `🧹 status: ticket work required`: Needs additional work before it is ready to be taken up
- `🚦 status: awaiting triage`: Has not been triaged by a maintainer

## Asking for help

Don't be afraid to ask for help when you're lost, that's literally the point of this community. :)
Ask your questions in the issue you're working on or into the discussion section if there's no attached issue.

### Happy coding 🎉🙌 and welcome to the TTU GDSC
